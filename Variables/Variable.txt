* What is Variable
-> Variable are containers for data.

-> JavaScript is Dynamically Typed language in which we have the freedom to store any value in any Variable. 

Variable Rules
1. Variable names are case sensitive; "a" & "A" is different.
2. Only letter, digit, underscore ( _ ) ans $ is allowed. (not even space).
3. Only a letter, underscore( _ ) or $ should be 1st character.
4. Reserved words cannot be variable names.

* Use of Camel Case to write variable in JavaScript is the best practise. Eg: fullName. isFollow , totalPrice ...... 

Types of Variable in JavaScript
1. var : 
-> Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope variable.

2. let 
-> Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable.

3. const  
-> Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.

Note:-> By default if any value is not assign to the variable it is undefined
